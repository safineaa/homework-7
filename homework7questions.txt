2. What are some examples of how PHP and JavaScript are alike and how they differ?

JavaScript and PHP are similar in their syntax and control structures (like their if else, switch, for, while statements)
They are also both dynamically typed and interpreted languages as well. 
JavaScript and PHP are different in the sense that PHP is a server-side language, while JS usually runs in the user's browser (even though Node.js allows JS to be used server-side)
JavaScript can also manipulate the DOM and PHP cannot. 

3. Define MVC, what are the responsibilities of each piece?

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller and it helps to develop UI and is divided into three components.
Model manages the state of the app, retrieves data, and defines the rules the data can be changed and manipulated.
View represents the UI of the app. It is responsible for the look of the app and rendering the data and forwarding user interactions to the controller.
Controller receives input from users from the view, processes the input (possibly updating the model), and returns the output display to the view.
